# aysÃ¬nvi
LefngapÃ¤ lÃ¬'fya

## What is this?
aysÃ¬nvi (no uppercase) is an esolang based on the Na'vi constructed language from Avatar.
The grammar is not fixed yet but some of the main goals of this project are:
 - having the least non-alphabetic symbols possible to represent the oral culture of Na'vi (including math operators),
 - making conjugation of verbs (here functions) have a purpose,
 - building an actually usable standard library that interfaces with lower level APIs to make this esolang technically productive.

## Addendum
I have been informed that I am forced to add that since this is made with Rust, it will obviously be ðŸš€ blazingly fast ðŸš€.
