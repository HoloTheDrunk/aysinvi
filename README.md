## What is this?
AysÃ¬nvi is an esolang based on the Na'vi constructed language from Avatar.
Some of the main goals of this project are:
 - having the least non-alphabetic symbols possible to represent the oral culture of Na'vi (including math operators),
 - making conjugation of verbs (here functions) have a purpose,
 - building an actually usable standard library that interfaces with lower level APIs to make this esolang technically productive.

## Why this name?
`ay+` -> **plural** prefix, causes [lenition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition)  
`tÃ¬nvi` -> task, errand, **step** (in an instruction)

### [Generic AST pattern replace](#progress)
This step aims to provide a nice API to enable advanced users to consisely define their own mini pattern finding language.  
This must be generic and user-defined as modules use different types of structs and enums that rarely have the same names or components.  
The general structure should be the same.  
For example:
 - `Fd(_,_,[Vd(_, _)])/d` could be a representation for  
 "Match any **F**unction **d**efinition with a single **V**ariable **d**efinition in its body and **d**elete its subtree from the AST".
 - `[Fd(name,argnames,body),Fc(name,args)]/s/[Vd(argnames,args),body]` could be a representation for  
 "Match any **F**unction **d**efinition followed only by a **F**unction **c**all to it and **s**ubstitute this match with a 
 **V**ariable **d**efinition of the call **arg**(s)uments followed by the function's **body**".

## Addendum
I have been informed that I am forced to add that since this is made with Rust, it will obviously be ðŸš€ blazingly fast ðŸš€
